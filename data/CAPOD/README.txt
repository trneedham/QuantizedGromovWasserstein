***SUMMARY***

This dataset contains CAPOD (CAnonically Posed 3D Objects Dataset), serving as a ground truth for evaluating the performance of canonical pose computation for generic 3D objects.

***CONTENT***

- A total of 180 3D objects are provided, that are uniformly distributed into a total of 15 object classes.
- 3D objects are provided in the Wavefront Object File Format '.obj'.
- Each 3D object is attributed a filename starting by 'm' and followed by a corresponding id integer number. 
- 3D objects are classified as described within the corresponding classification file 'CAPOD.cla' . The classification file is given in the format of the Princeton Shape Benchmark (http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/documentation/classification_format.html).
